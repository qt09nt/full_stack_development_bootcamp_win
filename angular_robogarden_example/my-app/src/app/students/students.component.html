<!-- iterate over the array of students using the directive *ngFor
the *ngFor directive loops over every student object in the array -->
<!-- wrapped between 2 curly brackets is the name of each student we iterate over.
This approach of displaying data, using {{}} is called interpolation -->
<div>
    <h2>My Students</h2>
    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let student of studentsArray">{{student.name}}</li>
